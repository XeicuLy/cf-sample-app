# Coding Style and Conventions

Based on CLAUDE.md and project configuration:

## TypeScript Style

- TypeScript is mandatory, no `any` type allowed
- Prefer arrow functions over function declarations
- Use named exports instead of default exports
- Use async/await instead of Promise chains
- Write beginner-friendly code with proper comments
- Follow functional programming principles

## Code Quality Tools

- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Biome**: Additional code checking and formatting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Type checking

## Development Approach

- Write code that's easy for beginners to understand
- Add appropriate comments to clarify code intent
- Follow functional programming paradigms
- Maintain consistent code style across the project
